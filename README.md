NBA Prediction
==============

**NBA game result prediction using Neural Network and Logistic Regression**

**Abstract**<br>

Deep learning is one of the advance machine learning tool that have shown
promising results in the domains of classification and prediction. One of the expanding
area which require good prediction accuracy is sports prediction. Team managers and
coaches are striving for machine learning models so that they can understand and formulate
strategies needed to win matches. In addition, betting websites are interested in
models which can increase their profits margins. These models are based on numerous
factors involved in the games, such as result of historical matches, box score statistics,
and opposition information. This paper provides an analysis of the literature in Machine
learning for sports prediction, focusing on the application of Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) along with other machine learning algorithms and their implementation on sport
result prediction. In doing so, we identify the learning methodologies, dataset utilised,
appropriate means of model evaluation, and specific challenges of predicting sport results.
This then leads us to propose a sport prediction framework through which deep
learning can be used as a learning strategy. This research will hopefully be informative
and of use to those performing future research in this application area.

**Introduction**<br>

National Basketball Association is one of the top three most popular sports in
USA and a global sensation, NBA is the most followed basketball league worldwide.
Over the last three decades, NBA has extended its reach to engage an increasingly
larger audience, according to the Nielsen media research the viewership of NBA for
2020-21 season average around 2 million viewers per game. The NBA has capitalised
on its success by continually improving the business model. For example, The
NBA All-Star weekend which takes place in February each year was once just considered
a midseason showcase for the top rated and most popular players. However, the
event has developed from a single event into a three-day, weekend-long extravaganza,
which includes a rookie game, skills challenge, three-point shootout, and a slam dunk
contest. NBA All-Star weekend attracts global media attention and has become an
enormous event for the sport. According to Ed Dixon from sports media, the NBA all
star weekend viewership for the season 2020-21 is approximately 6 millions, though it
got affected due to Covid and get reduced by 18% from last year.

The increased popularity of the NBA has translated to a successful business
model where revenue is following an increasing trend every year. Due to Covid the revenue
for 2020-21 season dropped by 10% but it still manage to capture a big sum of
8.3 billion dollars. In the season 2020-21 the top salary of a NBA player is around 43
million dollars for Stephen Curry who plays for Golden state warriors and is one of the
best 3 point shooter in the NBA history. Salary of top 10 players of NBA including all big
names in the league like LeBron James, Russel Westbrook, James Harden etc. is approximately
400 million dollars.

Let us take a look into the format of NBA, total 30 teams takes part in NBA out of
which 29 teams are from United States and 1 team is from Canada. All 30 teams are
divided into 2 conference of three divisions with five teams each. In a regular season,
each team plays total of 82 games, 41 at home and 41 away games. A team faces opponents
in its own division four times in a season (16 games). Each team played six
team from other 2 divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining 4
teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team played all the teams in the other conference
twice (30 games). NBA playoff begins in April, with eight teams participating
from each conference, all teams have a same objective which is to win the championship.
The three division winners, along with the team with the next best record from
the conference are given the top four seeds. The next four teams in terms of record are
given the lower four seeds. Playoff follows a knockout format. Each team plays an opponent
in a best of 7 game series and winner promotes to next round while the loser
gets eliminated from playoffs. Next round follows the same analogy and all but one
team from each conference remains. Conference winner are called as Eastern conference
champions for eastern division and Western conference champions for western
division. In the final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the champions of
both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals, and is held annually in June.
